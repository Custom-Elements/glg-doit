#Overview
DoIt embeds a task checklist into our applications so you can always tell
what needs to be done without going to yet another app.

DoIt tries to be smart, maybe even a smarty pants, and creates tasks for you
automatically based on your projects.

#Scenarios

##Daily Diligence Followup
Working on a large N diligence? DoIt will create a task to remind you to call
the client user.

##Missed Call Hunter
Calls scheduled with Go/Marklar know when they are supposed to start -- and if
they started. If the call didn't start at the appropriate time, DoIt will let
you know by creating a task to contact the missing persons.

##Post Call Followup
Calls scheduled with Go/Marklar know when they are over. This is great time
to call the CM and ask them for feedback, specifically if any questions went
unanswered and if there are other referrals you should set up.

##Out-Of-Office
Headed out of the office, DoIt will let someone cover for you. Your tasks
show up in their list while you are away.

##Delegate It
DoIt realizes you are busy, so tasks in your list can be delegate to any
colleague, which show up in their list -- and in yours under [Delegated] so you
can keep track if needed.
